# Applied-Statistics-Final-Project
According to the CDC, one person dies every 33 seconds from heart disease, and is the leading cause of death in the United States. Additionally, heart disease costs the United States about $239.9 billion each year from 2018 to 2019. This includes the cost of health care services, medicines, and lost productivity due to death.

Heart disease is characterized by the buildup of plaque in coronary arteries, which is associated with aging, high blood pressure, and diabetes. These, and many more risk factors can result in typical heart disease symptoms such as chest pain, heart attack, or sudden cardiac arrest.

Because of the many risk factors associated with heart disease, it is possible to predict when a person is more likely to suffer from symptoms and take preventative measures against the disease.

This project will explore factors related to heart disease, and look at the strength of their relationships. The data set used was found on Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/alexteboul/heart-disease-health-indicators-dataset), and was collected by the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System. This is a health related telephone survey by the CDC that collects responses every year. It contains over 244,000 survey responses for 22 questions regarding health.

The data in this set is written in such a way where a value of 0 represents ‘No’ to the question in the corresponding column, and 1 represents ‘Yes’. However, in the ‘Age’ column, the values 1-13 represent different age intervals. So is the case for the ‘Income’ and ‘Education’ columns.
